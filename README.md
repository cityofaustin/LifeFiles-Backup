# LifeFiles
Documentation sites for the LifeFiles project.

## Sites

[rwjf](https://cityofaustin.github.io/lifefiles-documentation/rwjf) is the main site. [design-system](https://cityofaustin.github.io/lifefiles-documentation/design-system) is the secondary site.

## Migration notes

If hosting these sites elsewhere, the URLs for **Brand Book, Design System, Design Principles, Style Guide**, and **UI Library** need to be updated to point to the new hosting location for the LifeFiles Design System site. These can be found on **index.html** within the `rwjf` directory. Some other links may also need to be updated during the migration process.
