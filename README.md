# LifeFiles
Documentation sites for the LifeFiles project.

## Sites

- [RWJF Landing Page](https://cityofaustin.github.io/lifefiles-documentation/rwjf) - The main site of LifeFiles.
- [LifeFiles Design System](https://cityofaustin.github.io/lifefiles-documentation/design-system) - Secondary site on design of LifeFiles.
- [LifeFiles Product Page](https://cityofaustin.github.io/lifefiles-documentation/product) - Secondary site of LifeFiles Product.

## Migration notes

If hosting these sites elsewhere, any absolute urls that start like `https://cityofaustin.github.io/` need to be updated to point to the new hosting location of the site. These can be found on **index.html** within the `rwjf` directory. Some other links also need to be updated during the migration process.
